        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently in my second year of a Bachelors of Computer Science degree, majoring in Software Engineering. I am a mature age student that decided to change careers after fifteen years in operations, logistics, and manufacturing. I am passionate about technology and its possible applications in improving the quality of living, access to information, and its use in scientific discovery. Below you can find some of the projects that I have worked on, both as a hobby and as part of my education</p>

  	<h2>Languages</h2>
  	<ul>
    	 <li>
      	  <a>Python</a>
      	  <p>Python was the first programming language that I learnt. In 2020 I completed the Python for Everybody specialization on Coursera taught by Charles Severance. In 2022, in the first year of my degree, Python was the language used in the first year unit Programming Principles. I am familiar with the fundamentals of Python, including data types, flow control, functions, classes, and data structures. Some of the libraries that I have used are BeautifulSoup4, Tkinter, discord.py, and requests.</p>
    	 </li>
    	 <li>
      	  <a>C++</a>
          <p>C++ was my first introduction to a C style language and my first statically typed, compiled language. I initially learnt C++ by converting one of my Python assignments from my first year unit (Programming Principles) into C++. In my second year we learnt C++ in the unit Object-Oriented Programming with C++. I prefer C++ over Python due to the fact that it is statically typed and the way that it uses header files for implementing classes. I am familiar with C++ data types, flow control, functions, classes and structs, inheritance, pointers and references, and overloaded functions/operators.</p>
